5c2cb4149461620001c075c2,high,No; I was totally paying attention to the study,Just memory,yes; if I knew the city,no; not really,yes; unique names stick in your brain and help,yes; some realistic names that are well known,no,no; it was enjoyable; thank you
55c237eefdf99b41c2f6481b,high,no; i just paused briefly to take a sip of water that was on my desk,none,if I had been there or knew someone from there; very familiar.,,,,,
670598a65450648ae2ddb83b,high,No; I was not doing anything else while participating in this study.  I was paying very close attention and concentrating.,Strategies?  I wasn't using any strategies that I was aware of. ,I have definitely heard of most of them; but how often; or how top of mind they might be; was more the sort of thing I thought of with regard to the Familiar metric.,If a name was more top of mind for me; I rated it as memorable.  sort of vaguely; I guess; I thought some names are more bland; so to speak; not very catchy or something.,There might be different interpretations of Unique.  I started with the idea of how many other cities might have the same name; because some of those names are shared by a greater or lesser amount of other cities in the US and around the world.  But sometime later in the study I began to think of unique as maybe having to do with the way a place is named; like  cities named for people; or cities with American Indian names; or cities with names that mean something that might mean the same as a different word that is the name of another city.,If I never heard of a name before; then I was less sure about how realistic it was.  I know for sure most of them are certainly real cities.  But there were a couple I wasn't sure about; so I had to try to think if it sounded like it MIGHT be the name of a city.,I have never participated in a study like this one.,it wasn't too boring; kind of interesting; It was a bit long.
60833ce5197d68cff9df1b83,high,Nope,It didn't even occur to me that a strategy would be necessary.  Almost all the names corresponded to a real city I knew of.  ,Most of the names got a high rating here because I knew of a city with those names.,Name is unusual or I've personally visited there got higher ratings.,If I was aware of more than one city with that name; I scored it low; otherwise; high.,Almost every single name corresponded to a city I knew of; so almost every single one got a high rating here.,Nope,Not really.  An interesting and different kind of study.  Good luck!
653f2424042d03012eb92ef5,high,no,I just tried to remember the names,Whether I had heard of them before or not,Whether I had heard of them before or not,IF the name was unusual ,If I knew it to be a real city,no,thanks
5c8f2ac8d7ecab0018d529aa,high,Nothing at all,I just checked all the cities.,Past experience by visiting the city.,Places and activities I could perform there.,Innovative and different than others in the area.,Simple and comfortable to live with family.,,
64bdfd7695f5559fff6d6817,high,No; I was only doing this study.,I did not use any strategies to help learn during the task. I just went with my gut feeling throughout this entire task.,I rated the city name based on how familiar I am with it.,I rated the city name based on whether or not the city names would be easy to remember.,I rated the city names based on whether or not a lot of cities are named that.,I rated the city names based on whether or not I could imagine a city being named that.,No; I have not completed this study anywhere else.,I enjoyed this experiment.
67dd40b531ab9c33ff61e98e,0,No,Had my full concentration on the task ,if it has applied before,Has seen it before,ho good it looks ,how natural it is ,no,No
67e8e0c0be5802df7311d109,high,No,No particular strategy,,,,,,
6627e1b9434a2e718ed099c2,high,no,just going off memory,i hear of before,if i can remember that name,if it sounded weird or hard to picture as a city etc,ive seen the name irl a lot,no,
571bdf806b0894001262df5b,high,No,Most of the places were familiar so I used association with what I knew about the place.,Did I know this city or heard of it.,Whether there was something I always associate with the city.,Whether it was a common name and whether I could place it in two places.,All words were realistic; not gibberish.,No,It was just right.
66ec7a70f8d1f4d108a4ec65,high,no,no stratagies just memory,If I remembered the name,If I remembered the name,If the name was not a ordinary name,If I ever heard the name before,no,I accidently went to fast on one of the earlier clicks and did not answer it correctly but that was thew only one.
651090beae417ded35c4ef2f,high,No,Tried to picture them mapwise geographically and say the state associated with out loud.  Twice.,If I had actually been to that city and my impression of it.,If the name came quickly to my mind when first seen,If it was so specific in its name that it wouldnt be suitible for anywhere but there.,City names are usually based on place characteristics or history and are usually easy to spot or I know them anyway.,No,It was engaging; worked well.  Thank you!
6100dfd366a4922c166c9a19,high,no,no strategies,Ive heard of it then it was somewhat familiar; never heard of it not at all; been there physically then very familiar,have heard a lot about it then memorable; hear a lot and been there very memorable; never heard of it and name not very unique then not memorable,double words are pretty unique but ones that sound military bases less unique; native american names a re unique,not spelt weird and could pronounce or know are real.,no,
6633e281f08a156a04a3379d,high,I was not distracted in any way.,Honestly didn't have any particular strategy. I was familiar with the almost all the names., I was so familiar with many of the names.,Based it on the sound of the name. ,The uniqueness of the name helped them to be more memorable.,Most of the names sound familiar; not made up.,I haven't participated in any study similar to this.,I had a difficult time on how to respond to the last set of questions. ( some ratings metrics can be highly subjective...)  But I enjoyed participating in the study.
626966a12d29060d48439d01,high,No,I just have a pretty good memory in general.,What I've heard of; or sounded similar to cities I've heard of.,Names that are not very common or there's a lot of history linked to the name,Those that aren't commonly used in the English day to day conversation,I imagined myself thinking of all cities of the U.S. and thought if it sounded possible ,no,no
62b628e4351d179f1ff6cc59,high,I was not doing anything else,I tried to remember the city name,I tried to remember specific words,I tried to think about the most memorable cities,I tried to think of unusual city names,I tried to think of cities I knew,Never participated in a similar study,No comments
660d93e761fbbc2c4bd8e758,high,no,stayed focused,if I had heard of them,if I remembered them,if they were different,if they sounded like a rel city,no,none
6130cdbb53f773b3125576a7,high, I was very interested in the study. I was not doing anything else,no strategies. I am an old guy and have heard of a lot of these places,I just went by what I knew for sure were places,I went by if they were cool enough that I would remember them,Some of the names were so interesting that they just seemed unique to me,very few of the places seemed not real to me,no,it was not boring.I am not sure what you were looking for
66d395c19ecb2d5c8acc6680,high,No,Tried to stay focused and attentive to each page. Would often think of the state the city was in and that helped me remember.,If I had hear the name before it was easier to remember.,Unusual names were easier to remember. Also if I associated the city with a state it was easier to remember.,If I thought the names were strange I rated them more unique.,Rated the city very realistic if I had heard the name before.,No,
5d0dd940312297000137d2a7,med,No.,None.,What was familiar.,What seemed memorable.,What seemed unique.,What was realistic in name (2 should have been 5s).,No.,There were two realistic choices that should have been fives.
62e19208352cd518d7b2f085,high,No; I was concentrated fully on the study alone.,I just went with what I knew and what I didn't; my gut instincts and how I felt.,If a name seemed familiar; or one that I knew for sure; I went with familiar.,If a name was one that wasn't easy to forget; I went with memorable. But if it was plain or ordinary; I went the opposite way.,A unique name is just that: a word you don't see often and not many words resemble it.,Realistic; I went with what felt like it would be appropriate to name a city.,I don't recall this specific study; but I do know I have done many studies from Aaron on MTurk over the years.,Nothing comes to mind. Thank you.
5de5dba9ff87c15699804260,high,I was not doing anything else.,I just called up a mental image of the town.,I was familiar with all of the town names; but I have also visited many of them.  ,I was trying to think of how easy it would be to remember the town name if I was driving through en route to another town.,If I couldn't think of another town of that name; I gave it a higher rating.,It seemed to me that they were all real towns; except perhaps for one.,No.,Seems about right to me.  In the second section I started to question whether the town was mentioned before.
565c931eba63db00051cd52d,high,I wasn't doing anything else.,I just tried to remember if I had read a name recently or not. Some words were obviously easier to remember; but I also went on feelings for others.,How certain I was about the state it went with; how strong the feeling of knowing was when reading the name,This was just how quickly I thought I could remember the name if asked to name cities. More unique names were more memorable.,Whether I could either think of or imagine there being other cities with the same name (like I imagine there's only one Pueblo and know there's multiple Salems),Whether I could name the state or country,,The study was fun.
66b77f8e10fb77f6a5b470da,high,no,I do sound the words out and put a twist on them as I say them to help me remember,If I knew the city name and especially if I knew the state name as well,If I remembered the city and state,If the name was different or distinct from normal state names,If I believed an actual city and state existed with that name,no,It was a lot of fun! Thanks
6695541a6e0d986b02c25dd9,high,No; I was fully focused on this task.,I just thought back to the ratings I gave after I saw each city and if I did not remember rating one it must have been new.,Have I seen or heard of the place before? was my thought process for this question.,Would I remember this place name even after study ends? was my thought process for this question.,Have I heard something similar to this like a name or is it something I never really heard before? was my thought process for this question.,Did the city name sound like something that already exists in the real world? was my thought process for this question.,No; I have never participated in a study like this one before.,No additional feedback.
628f572a2d1304a34b9e1a37,high,no,I paid attention to the names; especially those I knew. it helped during the 2nd part. ,If I was clearly aware of a city;s name ; it was familiar.,If it sounded distinctive; it was memorable.,If it sounded like no other city name; it was unique.,If it was a city I was familiar with; it was realistic.,no,I realize I missed a few of the nimber checks in the 2nd part. i was concentrating on the cities and inadvertently clicked.
67eec9e200be02ad51843d9b,high,nope nothing else,I recognized most of the cities names so when they popped up again it was pretty easy to say I had or hadnt seen them before,They got a 5 if I could identify what state the city was most familiar with.  And as I stated before I recognized most of the cities named. ,A 5 if I had been to the city or knew about the city through the news etc.  Lower ratings if I didn't know much about the city.,If I knew there were several cities with the same name it got a lower score. ,Almost all of the cities were realistic because I had heard the names before. ,Nothing like this no. ,Nothing else I can think of
62926b2bba027005e0a84475,high,no,remembering places I have been before; friends from cities; and old stories. I've travelled a lot. ,I KNEW it was really a city,Had unique sound or spelling,often similar to memorable ,IF it were a real place,no,no
66f8b447360d8c1892324f1b,high,nope. just doing the survey,I didn't use any strategies at all. I just concentrated on the names and I thought about when I was in the city last or not at all.,I thought about if I were there,how strange the name was,What state it was in,real city names. not made up. I was only unfamiliar with 1,nope. no other,it was super easy
666af0507b0a277a93214f66,high,no,I just tried to be quick so that the names would stay fresher in my short term memory. I also tried to associate countries or states to the names to help remember if I had seen it before. ,IF I had heard the name in passing; past conversations with tourist (I work in hospitality) ; If I had been there. ,I wondered if it was a famous city from tv and movies or not. ,If the spellig was unconventional to the US. ,If the city sounded American; British; asian; middle eastern when I said it aloud. ,I have not done a similar study before,It was a little long. And the option to see how good/bad your own memory was would be interesting to see at the end. 
61528277afcb4906d01e0442,high,Nothing else,I didn't really use any strategies. ,If I had heard the name before,If I would be able to remember the name,If it sounded interesting,If it was real or if I thought it was real,No,It wasn't boring. 
678e6eb7170e3a5da7c4ab91,high,no,i focused on familiar name to help me remember and also commonality,i rated by how often have seen the images,i rated based on attention and standout,i rated based on the subject matter,the accuracy of the image ,none,no comment
60ff7c8f4f066ccf6fe05587,high,Nope,I recognized a lot of the cities as capitals so that made recall easier,If I had heard about it a lot or been there; it got a 5,If I have heard about memories from a good collection of people; I deemed it memorable,I judged this based off of whether seeing this name pop up on my local news channel would give me pause,I decided this based off of if I thought the name looked misspelled,No,No
63bcbf7e0ac7e876387ef720,high,I was doing nothing else.,I studied the instructions carefully and tried to follow them.,Whether I had been there or heard of it.,If I clearly remembered that it was a real place.,I tried to recall if there were several cities with the name or only one.,This was based on my travels; studies; research; and reading.,no,
66231fc6e1ecba676935943a,high,Nope.,No strategies; just attempted to use my memory.,Have I ever been to or heard of the place before.,Was it a name that I would not easily forget.,Is it one of a kind or are there other places that share the same name or similar.,Does it exist in the real world?,No.,It was interesting enough; thank you!
673fd425abf60cdbd75ae360,high,No,I didn't use ant strategies; I just made sure to focus and pay attention,It was cities that I have heard of or even been in,Cities that I've heard of but are also popular,Cities that I haven't heard of or that I've heard of but as far as I know don't exist in more than one state/country,Cities that I know of. Some I didn't know and just didn't sound like real city names to me so I rated them less realistic.,No,No
5df97abeabec5d6fcbbc764d,high,No,I have been to many of the places named. I would think something like Pasadena; parade; great museum; Pasadena.,Have I been there? Often; yes. If not; have I ever heard of it? Often yes; in a meeting.,Many names like that are memorable to me. But the more vowels in the name; the more difficult for me.,If I've only heard of one of them; then I deemed the unique.,As I said; a town can be named pretty much anything. So most names are realistic.,No,It was a bit long. For some reason my number pad would not work so I had to stretch to the numbers at the top of my keyboard. That was odd; it always works and I know about the num lock. Now my back is really hurting.
6168b61ad8c0d63b37a92109,high,No.,I tried to think about whether I have heard of the city before and what states or countries it might be in.,How certain I am that I know about the city and how much I know about the city.,A rough estimation of how likely I would be to remember the name after an extended period of time.,A rough estimation of how many cities have this name; or how common the words that make up the name are.,How likely the name is to be of a real city.,No.,No.
66660a053b08e2a34f9b945c,high,no,just trying to use my first judgement if I'd seen the city name before,If I'd heard of them before or if I could see them being a city name somewhere in my subconscious ,If it's an easy name that rolls off the tounge; or it's a name in a different language might make it less memorable,If the only time I'd heard it was for a city or not,If it's actually the name of a city or sounds like made up jargon,no,no
66077f409f9052bc169c56de,high,no,I just read each name carefully and thought of the different states associated with the cities,Whether or not I knew that city had existed; either from hearing things about it; or if I had visited it.,I ranked some unique sounding cities as being more memorable; but I also ranked the cities that I have visited as memorable as well.,I ranked uniqueness based on whether I have heard the name before; and whether or not there are multiple cities/towns using that same name. I also considered whether or not the names were basic; or more creative.,I ranked this mostly based on whether or not I knew the city existed; or if i can imagine it being the real name of a city.,no,no; it was fine
67e2ec7b8e021808c0352a88,high,no,,no,no,yes,,no,no
5fd393664d8c020163cb3ef2,high,I was fully engaged on this survey only,I just tried to remember these names off-head,Those cities I have heard or visited especially from HistoRy or ones in the US,The names that sound special and also are popular,Names tat are just special,A name that can be associated with a city based on knowledge I have,Never,
63434fd4c74099dcf0bc49fd,high,No,I have memories tied to several of the cities.,If I had personally heard of them before.,If I had memories tied to them for any reason.,If I knew for sure that more than one existed it made them less unique.,Whether or not I had ever heard of them or been there.,No I have not.,No; it was fine. But please fix this final page questionnaire to read cities rather than images. 
64077ddd11208afe2bec171a,high,No I was only focusing on the study.,I didn't really use any particular strategy. I used my gut intuition and memory.,Whether I've seen the name before or not.,How I would compare it to other names and how memorable they are.,How interesting the name sounds.,Whether I could imagine a town/city actually being named the name in question.,No I have not.,
5e29cc3230cf9d03580c34bf,high,doing nothing else,I tried to simply rely on my own personal knowledge of cities; either I know of or have been to; and my own opinions of those names,any city I have been to is of course most familiar; but particularly cities in the US are more familiar to me; or large well known cities outside the US,cities with extremely unique names stood out more; or ones I have been too are especially memorable,cities with interesting names or no similar features like Fort or ville were more unique in general,most were realistic because most were cities I had heard of before,not that I can recall,
60fd0b053216a04db035ad9b,high,I was not doing anything else during this study.,I did not use any strategies other than fully reading instructions and prompts. I also just generally have a pretty good memory.,If I recognized the city but could not place what state or even country it was in I put slightly familiar. If I fully knew where it was in the world/had personally been there I said extremely familiar or whatever the adverb was.,Memorability kind of depended on uniqueness. ,My thought was pretty much just have I ever heard anything like this city name before? If i personally knew of multiple instances of it being used in different states or if it followed the pattern of -ville; -town or Fort-; or Las- it is not unique. Except for Hagerstown which is only a city in two states in America. ,Mostly; if the city name was one I knew or followed a similar pattern to general city names I found it realistic.,I have never participated in anything like this; but would happily do it again.,I found this entertaining 
67dd4210d92f4c3aac8d944c,high,No,Memorized the countries,If seen before ,If i have heard of it ,how natural it is ,How real it is ,no,no
67e406244bfad9999a051c1e,0,No,memorising the names of the countries,seen beore ,know about it ,natural it is ,how real it is ,no,No comment
6705f9372b81e6f4e1e195df,high,no,I repeated the names as I saw them in the first round,If I have heard it at all in conversations in real life or in tv or movies,if it was unique enough to stand out,if its a city name that I dont think every state would have one of or that just has a different spelling ,mainly whether or not I had heard it before and how unique it sounded,no,maybe not as many cities as it did get very repetitive almost to the point of boring

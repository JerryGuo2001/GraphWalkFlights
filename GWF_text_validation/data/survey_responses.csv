5c8f2ac8d7ecab0018d529aa,high,Nothing at all,I just checked all the cities.,Past experience by visiting the city.,Places and activities I could perform there.,Innovative and different than others in the area.,Simple and comfortable to live with family.,,
64bdfd7695f5559fff6d6817,high,No; I was only doing this study.,I did not use any strategies to help learn during the task. I just went with my gut feeling throughout this entire task.,I rated the city name based on how familiar I am with it.,I rated the city name based on whether or not the city names would be easy to remember.,I rated the city names based on whether or not a lot of cities are named that.,I rated the city names based on whether or not I could imagine a city being named that.,No; I have not completed this study anywhere else.,I enjoyed this experiment.
67dd40b531ab9c33ff61e98e,0,No,Had my full concentration on the task ,if it has applied before,Has seen it before,ho good it looks ,how natural it is ,no,No
6627e1b9434a2e718ed099c2,high,no,just going off memory,i hear of before,if i can remember that name,if it sounded weird or hard to picture as a city etc,ive seen the name irl a lot,no,
6100dfd366a4922c166c9a19,high,no,no strategies,Ive heard of it then it was somewhat familiar; never heard of it not at all; been there physically then very familiar,have heard a lot about it then memorable; hear a lot and been there very memorable; never heard of it and name not very unique then not memorable,double words are pretty unique but ones that sound military bases less unique; native american names a re unique,not spelt weird and could pronounce or know are real.,no,
626966a12d29060d48439d01,high,No,I just have a pretty good memory in general.,What I've heard of; or sounded similar to cities I've heard of.,Names that are not very common or there's a lot of history linked to the name,Those that aren't commonly used in the English day to day conversation,I imagined myself thinking of all cities of the U.S. and thought if it sounded possible ,no,no
62b628e4351d179f1ff6cc59,high,I was not doing anything else,I tried to remember the city name,I tried to remember specific words,I tried to think about the most memorable cities,I tried to think of unusual city names,I tried to think of cities I knew,Never participated in a similar study,No comments
62e19208352cd518d7b2f085,high,No; I was concentrated fully on the study alone.,I just went with what I knew and what I didn't; my gut instincts and how I felt.,If a name seemed familiar; or one that I knew for sure; I went with familiar.,If a name was one that wasn't easy to forget; I went with memorable. But if it was plain or ordinary; I went the opposite way.,A unique name is just that: a word you don't see often and not many words resemble it.,Realistic; I went with what felt like it would be appropriate to name a city.,I don't recall this specific study; but I do know I have done many studies from Aaron on MTurk over the years.,Nothing comes to mind. Thank you.
565c931eba63db00051cd52d,high,I wasn't doing anything else.,I just tried to remember if I had read a name recently or not. Some words were obviously easier to remember; but I also went on feelings for others.,How certain I was about the state it went with; how strong the feeling of knowing was when reading the name,This was just how quickly I thought I could remember the name if asked to name cities. More unique names were more memorable.,Whether I could either think of or imagine there being other cities with the same name (like I imagine there's only one Pueblo and know there's multiple Salems),Whether I could name the state or country,,The study was fun.
6695541a6e0d986b02c25dd9,high,No; I was fully focused on this task.,I just thought back to the ratings I gave after I saw each city and if I did not remember rating one it must have been new.,Have I seen or heard of the place before? was my thought process for this question.,Would I remember this place name even after study ends? was my thought process for this question.,Have I heard something similar to this like a name or is it something I never really heard before? was my thought process for this question.,Did the city name sound like something that already exists in the real world? was my thought process for this question.,No; I have never participated in a study like this one before.,No additional feedback.
666af0507b0a277a93214f66,high,no,I just tried to be quick so that the names would stay fresher in my short term memory. I also tried to associate countries or states to the names to help remember if I had seen it before. ,IF I had heard the name in passing; past conversations with tourist (I work in hospitality) ; If I had been there. ,I wondered if it was a famous city from tv and movies or not. ,If the spellig was unconventional to the US. ,If the city sounded American; British; asian; middle eastern when I said it aloud. ,I have not done a similar study before,It was a little long. And the option to see how good/bad your own memory was would be interesting to see at the end. 
61528277afcb4906d01e0442,high,Nothing else,I didn't really use any strategies. ,If I had heard the name before,If I would be able to remember the name,If it sounded interesting,If it was real or if I thought it was real,No,It wasn't boring. 
60ff7c8f4f066ccf6fe05587,high,Nope,I recognized a lot of the cities as capitals so that made recall easier,If I had heard about it a lot or been there; it got a 5,If I have heard about memories from a good collection of people; I deemed it memorable,I judged this based off of whether seeing this name pop up on my local news channel would give me pause,I decided this based off of if I thought the name looked misspelled,No,No
66231fc6e1ecba676935943a,high,Nope.,No strategies; just attempted to use my memory.,Have I ever been to or heard of the place before.,Was it a name that I would not easily forget.,Is it one of a kind or are there other places that share the same name or similar.,Does it exist in the real world?,No.,It was interesting enough; thank you!
673fd425abf60cdbd75ae360,high,No,I didn't use ant strategies; I just made sure to focus and pay attention,It was cities that I have heard of or even been in,Cities that I've heard of but are also popular,Cities that I haven't heard of or that I've heard of but as far as I know don't exist in more than one state/country,Cities that I know of. Some I didn't know and just didn't sound like real city names to me so I rated them less realistic.,No,No
6168b61ad8c0d63b37a92109,high,No.,I tried to think about whether I have heard of the city before and what states or countries it might be in.,How certain I am that I know about the city and how much I know about the city.,A rough estimation of how likely I would be to remember the name after an extended period of time.,A rough estimation of how many cities have this name; or how common the words that make up the name are.,How likely the name is to be of a real city.,No.,No.
66660a053b08e2a34f9b945c,high,no,just trying to use my first judgement if I'd seen the city name before,If I'd heard of them before or if I could see them being a city name somewhere in my subconscious ,If it's an easy name that rolls off the tounge; or it's a name in a different language might make it less memorable,If the only time I'd heard it was for a city or not,If it's actually the name of a city or sounds like made up jargon,no,no
66077f409f9052bc169c56de,high,no,I just read each name carefully and thought of the different states associated with the cities,Whether or not I knew that city had existed; either from hearing things about it; or if I had visited it.,I ranked some unique sounding cities as being more memorable; but I also ranked the cities that I have visited as memorable as well.,I ranked uniqueness based on whether I have heard the name before; and whether or not there are multiple cities/towns using that same name. I also considered whether or not the names were basic; or more creative.,I ranked this mostly based on whether or not I knew the city existed; or if i can imagine it being the real name of a city.,no,no; it was fine
67e2ec7b8e021808c0352a88,high,no,,no,no,yes,,no,no
5fd393664d8c020163cb3ef2,high,I was fully engaged on this survey only,I just tried to remember these names off-head,Those cities I have heard or visited especially from HistoRy or ones in the US,The names that sound special and also are popular,Names tat are just special,A name that can be associated with a city based on knowledge I have,Never,
64077ddd11208afe2bec171a,high,No I was only focusing on the study.,I didn't really use any particular strategy. I used my gut intuition and memory.,Whether I've seen the name before or not.,How I would compare it to other names and how memorable they are.,How interesting the name sounds.,Whether I could imagine a town/city actually being named the name in question.,No I have not.,
5e29cc3230cf9d03580c34bf,high,doing nothing else,I tried to simply rely on my own personal knowledge of cities; either I know of or have been to; and my own opinions of those names,any city I have been to is of course most familiar; but particularly cities in the US are more familiar to me; or large well known cities outside the US,cities with extremely unique names stood out more; or ones I have been too are especially memorable,cities with interesting names or no similar features like Fort or ville were more unique in general,most were realistic because most were cities I had heard of before,not that I can recall,
60fd0b053216a04db035ad9b,high,I was not doing anything else during this study.,I did not use any strategies other than fully reading instructions and prompts. I also just generally have a pretty good memory.,If I recognized the city but could not place what state or even country it was in I put slightly familiar. If I fully knew where it was in the world/had personally been there I said extremely familiar or whatever the adverb was.,Memorability kind of depended on uniqueness. ,My thought was pretty much just have I ever heard anything like this city name before? If i personally knew of multiple instances of it being used in different states or if it followed the pattern of -ville; -town or Fort-; or Las- it is not unique. Except for Hagerstown which is only a city in two states in America. ,Mostly; if the city name was one I knew or followed a similar pattern to general city names I found it realistic.,I have never participated in anything like this; but would happily do it again.,I found this entertaining 
67dd4210d92f4c3aac8d944c,high,No,Memorized the countries,If seen before ,If i have heard of it ,how natural it is ,How real it is ,no,no
67e406244bfad9999a051c1e,0,No,memorising the names of the countries,seen beore ,know about it ,natural it is ,how real it is ,no,No comment
6705f9372b81e6f4e1e195df,high,no,I repeated the names as I saw them in the first round,If I have heard it at all in conversations in real life or in tv or movies,if it was unique enough to stand out,if its a city name that I dont think every state would have one of or that just has a different spelling ,mainly whether or not I had heard it before and how unique it sounded,no,maybe not as many cities as it did get very repetitive almost to the point of boring
